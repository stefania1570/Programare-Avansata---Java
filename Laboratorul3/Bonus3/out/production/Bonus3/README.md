### Homework 3  
A social network contains persons and companies, each of them identifiable by unique names.  
In this network there are relationships of the following types: person-to-person (if they know each other, how?), and person-to-company (if the person works for that company, on what position?).  
There may be various types of "specialized" persons in the network, such as programmers or designers. 

✅Create the complete model: Person, Programmer, Designer, Company. All persons have a birth date.  
Each class must have at least one specific property, that others don't have (be creative).  
✅Each person will contain a Map defining the relathionships to other persons or companies.  
✅Create the Network class containing a List of identifiable nodes.  
✅Create a method that computes the importance of a node in the network, as the number of its connections to other nodes.  
✅Create a network object containing persons, companies and relationships and print it on the screen. When printing the network, the nodes must be ordered according to their importance.
